| **Servo Motors**                               | Controls the movement of sorting flaps or lids to direct different types of waste into the correct bins.                | 3        |
| **Resistors**                                  | Protect LEDs and manage current flow in the circuit.                                                                    | 3        |
| **LEDs**                                       | Each LED represents a type of waste (plastic, paper, or electronic) and lights up to show where the item is being sorted. | 3        |
| **Jumper Wires**                               | Connects all components to the breadboard and ESP32.                                                                    | 15+      |
| **Breadboard**                                 | For building and testing the circuit.                                                                                   | 1        |
| **USB Cable**                                  | Provides power to the ESP32 and components during operation or testing.                                                 | 1        |
| **OLED Display**                               | Displays real-time feedback such as waste type and sorting status.                                                      | 1        |
| **Battery Holder**                             | Holds the rechargeable batteries that power the system.                                                                 | 1        |
| **Li-ion Batteries**                           | Provide portable power to the system.                                                                                   | 4        |
| **5V DC-DC Step-Down Regulator (Buck Converter)** | Powers the ESP32 and sensors from the battery pack.                                                                     | 1        |
| **On/Off Rocker Switch**                       | Acts as a power switch for the entire system.                                                                           | 1        |
